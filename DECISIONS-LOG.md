# Decision log

## Initial Setup

- Decision: use as less of 3rd party libraries as it is reasonable.

Vanila CSS, Window.fetch()

- Justification:

to build this simple currency conversion tool Typescript React with the Vite build tool. I'll also use the plain css, without any additional pre/post processing libraries as this simple app doesn't require it.
